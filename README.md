The _International Classification of Diseases and Other Health Related Problems, Tenth Revision_ (ICD-10)
is commonly used for coding diagnoses in health data.

This package provides Types and functions for working with ICD-10 codes, and
country-specific versions (ICD-10-AM, ICD-10-CA, ICD-10-CM, ICD-10-GM).

The package is intended for researchers and other analysts working with ICD_coded
health data. It is not intended for clinical coding.

There are no ICD codes included in this package. ICD codes can be obtained from
