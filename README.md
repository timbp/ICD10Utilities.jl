The _International Classification of Diseases and Other Health Related Problems, Tenth Revision_ (ICD-10)
is commonly used for coding diagnoses in health data.

This package provides Types and functions for working with ICD-10 codes, and
country-specific versions (ICD-10-AM, ICD-10-CA, ICD-10-CM, ICD-10-GM).

The package is intended for researchers and other analysts working with ICD_coded
health data. It is not intended for clinical coding.

There are no ICD codes included in this package. ICD codes can be obtained from
the World Health Organization (WHO) or relevant bodies for country-specific versions.
